                    31 days or more prior to pick up: 25% of rental fee
                    30-8 days prior to pick up: 50% of rental fee
                    7-0 days prior to pick up: 100% of rental fee
                    No refunds for early returns of vehicles.

                    Note: With very few exceptions, and due to the considerable logistical, expense, and time involved
                    in doing them in such a large country, we do not offer pick ups and/or drops offs away from Buenos
                    Aires. If interested in a one-way rental let us know and we will do everything possible to
                    accommodate your needs.

                    VEHICLE PICK UP
                    Upon arrival to our site, you will be required to present a valid credit card and driver\\\'s
                    license. You need to be 25 years old or older in order to be a qualified driver and renter. An
                    International Driving Permit is not required.

                    You will be asked to sign a Rental Contract at the time of picking up the motorhome. We can e-mail
                    you a sample contract for your review upon request.

                    We will also go through the whole motorhome, explaining how each system works and testing them at
                    the same time. The vehicle will have a full tank of fuel (diesel) and fresh water. Please allow
                    about 1/2 hour of time in your schedule to do this procedure. This is a good time to ask questions!

                    You will be provided two sets of keys for everything.

                    You will also have a full gas bottle when picking up the motorhome. This should be enough for
                    cooking, using the water heater, and the space heater during your stay, unless you are planning an
                    extended visit. You don\\\'t need to refill the container before returning the unit.

                    There is a shopping center very close to our base, where you can get food and other supplies for the
                    trip.

                    EQUIPMENT
                    Your unit comes equipped with the following items, at no additional charge:

                    Driving Kit:

                    -
                    - Vehicle\\\'s owner manual
                    - Renter´s Booklet (with useful information about driving in Argentina, the vehicle, what to do in
                    case of an accident/emergency, etc.)
                    Kitchen Kit: Full set of dish, silverware and cooking utensils.

                    Bathroom Kit: Chemical toilet biodegradable liquid, two sets of towels per occupant.

                    Bedding kit: Sheets, goose down (douvet) comforters, blankets, and pillows.

                    Camping Kit: Camping folding chairs (one per user), camping folding table, extension cord (220v),
                    water hose, cooler, bucket, etc.

                    Vehicle Kit: Emergency road signals, fire extinguisher, second spare tire (upon request), emergency
                    vest.

                    DRIVING THE MOTORHOME
                    All of the vehicles\\\' controls are easy to use. However, keep in mind that it will probably take
                    you a while to become familiar with all of them. Take your time to adjust the driving seat, mirrors,
                    check lights, radio, etc. All our units have manual transmission ( 6-speed). They have a 100 to 120
                    km/hr cruising speed, depending on the unit. Driving in Latin America is a bit different than
                    Europe, Canada, Australia or the U.S. (unless you come from southern Italy!!). Many drivers in
                    Argentina tend to drive aggressively, which doesn\\\'t mean that you should drive like a possessed
                    race pilot, just be aware of it and act defensively. We recommend driving only during daylight
                    hours, at 90 to 100 km/hr max. Road signage in the whole country is generally good and reliable.

                    Always be aware of the oversized dimensions of a motorhome!! (If you drive one at home, you are
                    probably used to this). Keep in mind the height of the vehicle when near trees, overhead cabling,
                    parking structures, etc. When approaching a highway toll booth, select the appropriate lane for
                    higher vehicles, usually towards the right end (just follow the buses or trucks).

                    User will be responsible for any traffic violations taking place during the rental period. The
                    vehicle use will be limited to the normal use of a motorhome. Transporting additional passengers or
                    load is not allowed and will cancel the insurance protection. Only the people designated in the
                    rental agreement will be permitted to drive the motorhome. Please see our Rental Contract for
                    additional information.

                    Overnight stays: for safety issues, we encourage to take advantage of the many and inexpensive
                    campgrounds available, especially in the tourist areas. However, other places can be used for
                    overnight stay, under the right circumstances. For example, if you are on the road on your way to a
                    destination and need a place, ask a gas station attendant if you can park for the night. If you are
                    in a remote beautiful spot all by yourself, it is probably OK to spend the night there. In all
                    cases, check the surroundings first and make sure you have a good feeling about the place and that
                    you are not violating local regulations or private property.

                    Smoking tobacco or any other substance is not allowed inside the vehicle, under any circumstances.
                    Driving while intoxicated with alcohol or drugs is not only extremely dangerous but illegal in
                    Argentina.

                    Unfortunately, we cannot allow pets in our units.

                    Police highway check points are common and safe in Argentina and Chile. They will ask you to see a
                    valid driver\\\'s license, vehicle registration, and current insurance. It is always a good idea to
                    keep a copy of your passport and the Rental Contract handy as well. You should have no problems as
                    long as you can show them the above mentioned documents.

                    VEHICLE RETURN
                    Vehicle must be returned by the stipulated day and time to the Andean Roads depot, unless previously
                    arranged differently. Allow some extra time to go through all the paperwork.</p>
